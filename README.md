## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (Latest LTS version recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone [your-repo-url]
cd electron-learner
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Development

Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start both:
- Vite dev server for React
- Electron in development mode

### Testing

Run E2E tests:
```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

Run unit tests:
```bash
npm run test:unit
```

### Building

Build for your current platform:
```bash

npm run dist:mac

# For Windows (x64)
npm run dist:win

# For Linux (x64)
npm run dist:linux
```

## Project Structure
